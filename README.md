# twitterbot
A simple Twitter Bot I made for JayHacks 2017

The bot searched Twitter for mentions of specific words, and wrote a response to the person that mentioned that word. 

In order to run the bot, navigate to the folder where the repository is cloned, and type the command `node twitterbot.js` (assuming that nodejs is already installed on your machine)
