# twitterbot
A pretty silly Twitter Bot I made for JayHacks 2017

The bot searched Twitter for mentions of specific words, and wrote a response to the person that mentioned that word. This was originally a way to automate promotion of the latest episode of my podcast. 

In order to run the bot, navigate to the folder where the repository is cloned, and type the command `node twitterbot.js` (assuming that nodejs is already installed on your machine). You'll need to input your own personal developer key into the secret object in order for the bot to work.

This project was an attempt to learn something about how web APIs work, and also served as my first introduction to node.js. I think the outcome of the project was successful given these goals.

This project has not been maintained since February of 2017.
